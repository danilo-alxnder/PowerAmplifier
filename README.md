Welcome to the README of PowerAmplifier, an audio amplifier designed to drive a 4Î©-loudspeaker using an input signal of max 100mVRMS and power supply 10V.

## Summary

>A three-stage-amplifier was designed, starting with a common source circuit, next a common drain circuit, and ending with a class AB amplifier. This cascade is needed in order to get high input impedance, low output impedance, and efficient voltage transfer between stages. The distortion of the amplifier was ensured to be as low as possible. This was done by avoiding clipping and cross-over distortion.
